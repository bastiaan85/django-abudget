# django-abudget
Just another home budget application, written in Django. Just because I haven't found something perfectly fit. And I definetly don't like then someone have all my finance information, so, this project is being written for people like me, who can manage to start it on local server for personal use. Or ask someone who can :-)

It's draft project with my personal vision of such things. Add income, add information about transactions, see outcome - balance, graphs with most expensive categories, etc.

It's just started and not ready for production or just home use yet. I will write here then I will migrate to it.

I am going to make a lot of ajax stuff here, so - no form error display, and some things also done quick way, not right way. I will replace it to completely different code anyway, when time comes.

Going to use react to handle client-side data processing logic, but now jquery is okay here.

Going to make install and other instruction later.
